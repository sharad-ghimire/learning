### Introduction to Algorithms

Algorithm is really just a set of operation for acomplishing a task. Like the algorithm to make make peanut butter jelly sandwich. Algorithms can really speed up our code.

```python
def make_sandwich(knife, bread, pb, j):
    slice1 = knife.spread(bread[0], pb)
    slice2 = knife.spread(bread[1], j)
    sandwich = [slice1, slice2]
    return sandwich
```
